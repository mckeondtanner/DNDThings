# D&DThings
A place to put my D7D projects

# D&D HP
Code for my characters that represent the gain and loss of several types of HP during combat.

# D&D HP Functions
The same thing for D&D HP but it uses functions and is overall better.

# Random Character
Every time you run it, it produces a character with a random class, subclass, race, and background.

# Simple D&D
Provides a space to put in numbers, adds them up, then prints the sum. Most useful for adding damage rolls together.
